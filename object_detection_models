Object detection is a supervised machine learning problem
For object detection following are some of the models:
1| Fast R-CNN
2| Faster R-CNN
3| Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
4| Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)
5| Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN)
6| Single Shot Detector (SSD)
7| Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP-net)
8| YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Differences between RCNN and YOLO are as follows:
