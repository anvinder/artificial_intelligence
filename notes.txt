Goal:
- Train images based on yolo5 for traffic signs. Goal is to train it on my own dataset and check the efficiency to show real traffic data. 

Steps in using Yolov5
- Get the dataset(public.roboflow.ai)
- Annotate the iamges (CVAT, labelImg, VOTT). The annotations can be in coco json, tensorflow, object csv, VOL csv, labelImg, VAT, labelbox. 
- Create YAML for training
