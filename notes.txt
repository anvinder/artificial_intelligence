Goal:
- Train images based on yolo5 for traffic signs. Goal is to train it on my own dataset and check the efficiency to show real traffic data. 

Steps in using Yolov5
- Get the dataset
    - public.roboflow.ai
    - openimg dataset
- Annotate the iamges (CVAT, labelImg, VOTT) (To create bounding box). The annotations can be in coco json, tensorflow, pascal VOC, YOLO. 
- Annotate using 
    - CVAT
    - Labelimg
    - VOTT
    - Annotation can be of the following types: Bounding box, polygon segmentation, semantic segmentation, 3D cuboids, Key-Point and Landmark, Lines and        Splines (link: https://towardsdatascience.com/image-data-labelling-and-annotation-everything-you-need-to-know-86ede6c684b1)
- Convert annotations to coco format
- Create YAML for training
- YoloV5 training
- YoloV5 Inference
