Goal:
- Train images based on yolo5 for traffic signs. Goal is to train it on my own dataset and check the efficiency to show real traffic data. 

Steps in using Yolov5
- Get the dataset
    - public.roboflow.ai
    - openimg dataset
- Annotate the iamges (CVAT, labelImg, VOTT) (To create bounding box). The annotations can be in coco json, tensorflow, pascal VOC, YOLO. 
- Annotate using 
    - CVAT
    - Labelimg
    - VOTT
    - Annotation can be of the following types: Bounding box, polygon segmentation, semantic segmentation, 3D cuboids, Key-Point and Landmark, Lines and        Splines (link: https://towardsdatascience.com/image-data-labelling-and-annotation-everything-you-need-to-know-86ede6c684b1)
- Convert annotations to coco format ( no need to do this if you use labeImg.exe coz that can create direct yolo based txt files)
- Create YAML for training (No need for this): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/train-your-own-yolov5-object-detection-model/: 
    Once dependencies are installed and data is ready now we need to configure a YAML file to train the model. For that, you open any text editor and create a file            “coco.yml” inside the folder “YoloV5/data/”. The content of the file would be like this:
        # train and val data as 1) directory: path/images/, 2) file: path/images.txt, or 3) list: [path1/images/, path2/images/]
        train: /Users/gouravbais/yolov5/coco/images/train2017
        val: /Users/gouravbais/yolov5/coco/images/val2017


- YoloV5 training: Use this command from the terminal: python train.py --img 416 --batch 12 --epochs 50 --data ./data/coco.yml --weights ./weights/yolov5x.pt
- YoloV5 Inference: use this command: python detect.py --img 416 --source ./detect/test_data --weights ./weights/best.pt --conf-thres 0.4
